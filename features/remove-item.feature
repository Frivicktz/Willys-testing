  As a customer
  I want to be able to remove a product I put in my basket
  So that i can regret what I put in my basket.

  Background:

    And cookies has been accepted

  Scenario: Remove item
    Given the category "Mejeri, ost & Ã¤gg" was selected
    And that a product was added to the basket
    And that the delivery option was closed
    And that second product was added to the basket
